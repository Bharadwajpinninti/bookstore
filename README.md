Our online bookstore is a full-featured web application developed using MERN technologies, offering 
a seamless and comprehensive platform for book enthusiasts. Users can sign up, log in, and search

select their desired books and place orders directly through the site. With a robust review and rating 
system, users can share their thoughts and rate books, enhancing the community-driven experience.

The bookstore categorizes its extensive collection into various genres including "Fiction, Children,

options for all readers. While it does not support online book reading, it excels in providing a user friendly interface and efficient navigation for purchasing books.
